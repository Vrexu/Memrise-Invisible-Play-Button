# Memrise-Invisible-Play-Button

This project is for memrise language course fans who want to learn with the locals, without distractions. 

It's a Tampermonkey script that hides the play button appearing at the start and end of each video, covering it and causing distraction.

You can still click on the videos to replay them.
